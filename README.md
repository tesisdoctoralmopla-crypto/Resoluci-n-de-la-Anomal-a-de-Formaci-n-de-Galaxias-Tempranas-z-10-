## **Extended Description of the Paper: Constitutive Tensor-Scalar Gravity (TCG-CS-F)**

The paper proposes the **Constitutive Tensor-Scalar Gravity (TCG-CS-F)**, a non-local tensor-scalar gravity framework, as a unified and parsimonious solution to the two most pressing challenges facing standard cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM): the JWST Crisis and the $\sigma_{8}$ Tension.

### **I. The Cosmological Crises**

The Standard Cosmological Model is challenged by recent observations:

1.  **The JWST Crisis: Massive Galaxies at $z>10$**
    The *James Webb Space Telescope* (JWST) has detected the existence of mature, massive disk galaxies at very early epochs of the Universe ($z>10$). This demands a much higher rate of structure growth than is allowed by standard General Relativity (GR).
2.  **The $\sigma_{8}$ Tension**
    This is the persistent discrepancy in the measurement of structure clustering. Measurements from the early Universe (CMB) suggest one rate of growth, while those from weak lensing (late Universe) indicate lower clustering, requiring a slower rate of growth in the late Universe.

### **II. The Unifying Mechanism: $G_{eff}(z,k)$**

TCG resolves both issues through an **Effective Gravity dependent on epoch and scale** ($G_{eff}(z,k)$). This mechanism is mediated by the Constitutive Polarity Field ($\Psi$).

#### Effective Gravity Formula
The $G_{eff}(z,k)$ function is derived from the linearized TCG field equations coupled to the FLRW cosmological background.

$$G_{eff}(z,k)=G\left[1+\frac{2\beta^{2}}{1+Q(z,k)}\right]$$

* $G$: Gravitational constant.
* $\beta$: Fundamental coupling constant of TCG.
* $Q(z,k)$ (Constitutive Screening Factor): Depends on the redshift ($z$) and the scale of the perturbation ($k$).

#### Mechanism of Unification

The behavior of $Q(z,k)$ allows TCG to dynamically adjust the gravitational force based on epoch:

1.  **Early Universe ($z\ge10$): Self-amplification**
    In the early Universe, $Q(z)$ is very small, resulting in minimal gravitational dumping. This produces a massive **self-amplification** of gravity: $G_{eff} \gg G$. This amplification (on the order of $G_{eff} \sim 5-10G$) accelerates the rate of structure formation, allowing the formation of massive galaxies at $z>10$ and resolving the JWST Crisis.

2.  **Late Universe ($z\le1$): Moderation**
    In the late Universe, $Q(z,k)$ increases due to high local density. This **moderation** keeps $G_{eff}(z,k)$ very close to $G$ in the low-$z$ limit, which slightly slows down the late growth of structures and relaxes the $\sigma_{8}$ Tension.

### **III. The Pillar of Consistency: $\alpha=3$**

The parsimony of TCG is based on the fact that the non-linear exponent ($\alpha$) of the Field Equation is not a free parameter, but a necessary consequence of the theory's internal consistency.

#### The Non-Relativistic Field Equation
The non-relativistic field equation for the constitutive scalar potential is:

$$\nabla^{2}\Phi=4\pi G\rho_{m}\left(\frac{-\Phi}{\Phi_{0}}\right)^{\alpha}$$

#### The Fixed Point
The only condition for TCG-CS-F to reproduce the **Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR)**—the phenomenological success of MOND describing galactic rotation curves—in the weak-field limit, is the imposition of the fixed point:

$$\alpha=3$$

This value ensures the asymptotic transition $a_{obs}\propto\sqrt{a_{N}a_{0}}$, unifying TCG with galactic phenomenology (flat rotation curves).

---

### **IV. Conclusion**

TCG-CS-F provides a unified and coherent solution to the cosmological problems, where the same physics that dictates cosmological evolution also dictates galactic phenomenology (by imposing $\alpha=3$). The theory makes clear and falsifiable predictions that position it as a robust alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, including a non-zero radial gradient of the PPN parameter $\gamma$ in the Solar System.
